<h1>Personal Profiles</h1>
<p><b>Brandon Lopresti – S3921161 - S3921161@student.rmit.edu.au.</b> I was born in Australia with a family background of Italian heritage. My past education is only that of high school and I have started taking an interest in IT therefore taking this course. I only speak one language, English. My hobbies include basketball, gaming, and media in general. I have been interested in IT for as long as I can remember. My childhood was in a time where technology was developing at such a fast rate. I started playing video games at a very young age and transitioning into high school I got my very first laptop. When I got my first laptop my interest to learn IT grew and I found myself seeking out information about how it all works. I love the creativity of technology and how limitless it seems. The team I will be working with is The Coop. Everyone a part of The Coop shows such enthusiasm and drive to do well as well to help one another. I am very glad to have them a part of my group making this experience super easy.<br>

<p><b>Callum Lambeth - S3921235 - S3921235@student.rmit.edu.au.</b> I was born and raised in Queensland and I moved to Melbourne in 2017. From a young age, all hardware has been able to grab my attention. I have loved seeing how things work, pulling them apart, mostly by pulling them apart and putting them back together. When I got to high school and learning about software became available to me, I eagerly took the chance to learn more about how everything technology works. My passions and interests in IT are with PC building as well as coding. The hands-on and potential for problem solving aspects are huge factors for me and when everything comes together and it works, there is no better feeling in the world. I have no formal experience in the IT field; however, I have built several computers as well has helped friends troubleshoot issues they have had. I have also in the past dabbled in coding back in high school. I am part of The Coop, arguably the greatest group of people in this course. The way everyone in the group gets along is more than I could have hoped for and is going to be the gateway to everyone giving this assignment everything they have because we will all want everyone to not just pass, but pass with flying colours. <br>

<p><b>Connor Litchfield - S3913885 - S3913885@student.rmit.edu.au.</b> I have been pulling apart appliances and electronics since I could pick up a screwdriver, I was luck enough to attend a primary school that had computers albeit very few and very old. I love coding to make random little pieces of VBS software to help me with my daily life at work and at home, but my true passion lays in reverse engineering. I have had experience mainly in a hobby sense with, Raspberry Pie, VBS (lots of experience), C++, Python, Arduino, 3 Modelling, AutoCAD, Paint shop, Game Dev (Unreal), Android Dev. I am super excited to start my Bachelor of Information tech, I am part of team The Coop. The Coop consist of the coolest group people I have ever had to work with. I am excited to be working with these wonderful people.<br>

<p><b>Daisy - S3923673 - S3923673@student.rmit.edu.au.</b> My parents both immigrated to Australia from Vietnam during a war. My mum’s side is Chinese and my dad’s side is Vietnamese. I can speak neither but I can understand Cantonese. My hobbies have changed a lot recently and that is due to autoimmune conditions that I have developed in the last 3 years. They are called cholinergic and cole urticaria. I used to compete for surf lifesaving with surf boats, I loved to swim and participate in several sports. Now I frequent the computer a lot more. Playing games, watching anime or practicing.  My IT interest mainly revolves around machine learning and AIs. I also have very basic understandings of programming. I look forward to working with The Coop and seeing what we can achieve together. <br>
</p>
<p><b>Michael - S3921705 - S3921705@student.rmit.edu.au.</b> My name is Michael I have a European background, but I was born in Australia. In 2019 I graduated from year 12 and pursued plumbing for about 2 years and realised that I wouldn’t be happy working as a plumber for the rest of my life so now I work part time as a plumber while I study IT at RMIT. My interest in IT started when I played a video game on the pc when I was 8 years old, I found it difficult to make friends at school and I couldn’t find anything to do at home. That’s when I started playing games on the computer and Nintendo 64. Playing games helped me throughout all my schooling, taking me away from the real world that’s filled with stress and anxiety at times. I've always felt attached to computer technology ever since I started using it, but I've never learnt how they work and what happens behind the scenes, so now I want to take my chance to take my interest in IT further by taking an IT course and to find my passion in IT. I currently have my eye on Cyber security but I'm not 100% sure what that career involves in detail. The only experience I’ve had was IT class in high school, we covered a bit of python and algorithms. I’ve also built a few computers for fun. During assignment 2 and 3 I’ll be working with The Coop who are very easy to get along with and are quite supportive to one another. So, I am very happy to be part of The Coop.<br>

<p><b>Nemat S3856300 - S3856300@student.rmit.edu.au.</b> My name is Nemat, I am 26 years old. I come from Syria. I came to Australia, Melbourne 4 years ago. I finished a high school in my country but could not complete my studies at university due to the war has been started. When I arrived at Melbourne, studied 2 years of Advanced Diploma of Information Technology and Computer System Technology at TAFE. I also did CCNA courses with Cisco. Since I did Cisco course, I have been loved the Networking. Now, I am studying full time bachelor’s degree. I have many IT’s interest since I started my study in IT field. The top 3 for; Networking, Programming and Computer Science but the most interesting for me is Networking (network fundamentals, network access, IP connectivity, IP services...) so, this my passion and my goal after finishing the bachelor’s degree. I don’t have work experience as I haven’t worked yet. I am in a the group The Coop, a team of the kindest and most helpful people. I am excited to do this subject with them. Wishing all the best to all of them.<br>

We each have our own learning style, and fortunately with this being an online degree it allows us to explore what we are being taught in the way that works best for us.<br>
Between the six of us, we all share common results from the test, we feel this means that we will be able to understand each other with ease and this will lead to a more effective working environment. Common themes between all of us are that we all have the ability listen and be open to other’s ideas. We also are all quite socially competent, allowing us to convey our thoughts and ideas in an open conversation.<br>
The results from each of the tests indicate that we bring a healthy balance of positive traits to the group. Each of us bring our unique strengths, each excelling in different aspects to help provide support to everything and anything our team needs.<br></p>

<h1>Tools</h1>
<br>
<h2>Github</h2>
<p>In order to facilitate the creation of this report our team have used Github.<br>
We have created a Github repository and invited all our team members to be collaborators in it.<br>
We have decided to have a minimum requirement of 3 members approve a pull request, this keeps the process diplomatic and will minimize user error in 
the code, because now 3 sets of eyes have to look at it.<br>
The activity log on Github gives us a very clear overview of all changes made in the Github, and removes all ambiguity esspecially in situations where a team member would be unavaliable. </p>

<p>These are shortened URL links, it was decided by the group that to have
a shortened URL without out group name to the repository looks much nice,
google firebase and their Dynamic Links service was very handy here.</p>
<p>Link to our Repository: <a href="https://thecoop.page.link/Repository">https://thecoop.page.link/Repository</a><br>
Link to our Homepage: <a href="https://thecoop.page.link/Home">https://thecoop.page.link/Home</a></p>
<p>GitHub has proven to have a stellar audit trail every change is tracked. All the team members have done very well making and managing branches pull requests and merges.</p>

<!-- It Interview -->
<div ID="ItInterview">
<h1>Interview with a IT specialist</h1>
<p>On the 29th of September we interviewed Jon O’Shea about his job as a Data Administrator. He gave us many insights into his daily work life, working with large databases. During the interview we touched on points such as: databases, what a data administrator does, how to work well in a team and how to get a job in IT. </p>
<p>Analysing Data is one the most import roles a data analyst can do and with the help from Gartner many projects can be put together. Gartner is the leading research and advisory company around the globe. They have ever expanded research to provide to companies around the world, providing advice and tools they need to achieve their goals and build a great organisation. When data analysis receives projects, they get asked questions on how the project will be developed. Gartner is a great company to visit to identify and evaluate trends in a database which can help data analysis proceed with their project.</p>
<p>Being a data analysis requires understanding users and predicting what they will do or what they need for the job and problem and if the data stops working due to user input the data analysis must be good at problem solving and resolving the issue. It is important to have attention to detail when manipulating data, so the quality of the data stays decent and spotting mistakes other users make. Backing up files is a must because technology is not 100% reliable and files can become corrupted or the data in the file has been edited incorrectly crashing the file. This can also be avoided by branching off from the main project editing it in a separate branch. When projects are branched off it creates a copy of the project in a different timeline allowing the user to manipulate it however, they seem fit. The most challenging part of the job is implementing new systems but working together as a team with more communication can make this job easier for everyone. Try and look for a way to challenge yourself within the company to learn new things and to improve your quality of work. When you are confident enough you can go even further and look for improvement in your work by making managing projects more efficiently and try cutting corners with keep the quality in tacked, making it easier for yourself and the end user.  Don’t plan too far ahead of the project because technology is changing rapidly in the recent years changing up the structure and systems of the company.</p>
<p>Most IT projects are done in teams. Every team is different and will face challenges. Mr O’Shea spoke about main components that make teams run better. Trust was the first one, meaning that we need to trust each other’s abilities and each other. Doubting someone can make them feel incompetent that could lead to low work ethic. Another part is diversity. Keeping a team diverse opens it to new ideas and concepts as every person has a different perspective. Similarly, to trust communication plays a large role in team performance. If people do not communicate ideas or opinions well it could lead to conflict and missed opportunities with concepts. Jon also mentioned the importance of being open to other ideas and allowing equal space to share their opinions. Letting your teammates be heard helps the team be cohesive with all parts of the project and will aid in accord. Seeking regular feedback and allowing people to make mistakes further assists in improving the quality of work output by each individual member of the team. Letting your team know about your views and vice versa will help the overall flow of the project. </p>
<p>Getting into the IT industry has evolved a lot since it’s initial conception. Although you are not required to have certification there is an advantage to having one as it shows you have understanding to a certain level. With studying you can find many apprenticeships hosted by small and larger companies. The benefit to this is that you can study and work at the same time and your employer may want to hire you after the completion of your degree. Cadet ships are also a good option that facilitates on-site learning and growth. It tends to be more hands on and done at the completion of your degree or if you have no degree at all. Graduate programs, much like the name suggests, are for students who have graduated and are ready to begin one of their first jobs in the field. It often is supported by larger companies, and you get a mentor to help you to along the way. Tertiary holiday programs are run so that students can gain experience with full time work without the additional stress of study. It is a great way for employers to see that you are eager and are actively looking to learn more. Finally, unpaid work and volunteering is great to get both experience and notoriety that will hopefully lead to an employer reaching out to you for job opportunities. However, unpaid work is very easily turned into free labour so letting them know you will not work over 6 months without getting paid is optimal experience. There are several ways to get into the IT industry and it depends on the person to pick which route is best for them. </p>
<p>Overall, IT is a very broad blanket term used for many niches but important roles in modern society. Interviewing a professional about their field allowed a better understand on what a job in IT really looks like. Learning about data analyst specifically, teamwork, and getting into the industry itself.</p>

<h1>IT Technologies</h1>

<h2 id="Cyber">Cybersecurity What does it do?</h2>
<h3>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</h3>
<p>With machine learning, cybersecurity frameworks can analyse patterns and learn from them to assist anticipate similar attacks and react to changing behaviour. 
It can assist cybersecurity groups to be more proactive in avoiding dangers and reacting to dynamic attacks in real time. It can decrease the amount of time spent 
on routine assignments and enable organizations to utilize their assets more strategically. Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence that gives 
frameworks the ability to naturally learn and progress from involvement without being explicitly modified. Machine learning centres on the improvement of computer 
programs that can access information and utilize it to memorize for themselves. The path of learning starts with observations or information, such as illustrations, 
coordinate encounters, or instruction, to search for designs in data and make better choices within the future based on the illustrations that we offer. The essential 
point is to allow the computers learn naturally without human modifications or help and alter activities accordingly.</p>
<h3>What can be done now?</h3>
<p>Machine learning identifies threats by continually checking the conduct of the network for irregularities. Machine learning engines process massive sums of 
information in near real time to find basic occurrences. These methods permit for the detection of insider threats, obscure malware, and policy violations. Machine 
learning can foresee dangerous websites online to help stop individuals from clicking on the website. Machine learning analyses Web action to naturally distinguish 
attack foundations organized for current and rising threats. Algorithms can detect malware that's attempting to run on endpoints. It distinguishes new malicious files 
and movement based on the properties and practices of known malware. Machine learning can secure productivity by examining suspicious cloud app login movement, 
recognizing location-based irregularities, and scans the IP repeatedly to recognize threats and risks in cloud apps and platforms.</p>
<h3>What is likely to be able to do be done soon?</h3>
<p>Machine learning can help cybersecurity more precisely to identify potential attacks. However, in a few cases these advancements can cause strategies that brings 
new malicious software of their own. A wide range of particular assignments may be completely or mostly computerized with the use of machine learning, with some forms 
of "vulnerability, discovery, deception, and attack disruption. "But a lot of transformative conceivable outcomes still require critical machine learning breakthroughs. 
We expect that machine learning will give incremental progress to cyber defenders, but it is unlikely to change the industry excepting extra breakthroughs. A few of the 
transformative impacts may come from making under-utilized protective procedures available to more organizations. Machine learning will neither be offense-biased nor 
defence-biased, it may change the danger scene by making certain sorts of procedures more engaging to attackers or defenders.</p>
<h3>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h3>
<p>Quantum computers use a new mode of computing based on qubits rather than bits. These units are more adaptable than bits in that they can be on, off or superposed 
between the two. They’re so condensed to the degree that particles are physically connected even though they’re physically separate. These properties let quantum computers 
to move data around and to perform assignments faster and more efficiently than standard computers. The outcomes for quantum computing are endless. Undoubtedly, researchers 
could use quantum computing to acquire AI to a new level. They might create new materials, discover cures to illnesses and alter life in other ways. Large scale quantum 
computers will increase the amount of power output to help cyber defenders in the long run and open new opportunities. Quantum cybersecurity will use the power to identify 
and avoid quantum cyberattacks before they cause a trouble. But it might end up back firing, as quantum computing may also make new exposures and developments to hack and 
plan malicious software and work out the layers of encryption created to protect sensitive data.</p>

<h2>Cyber Security and its likely impact.</h2>
<p>Cyber security will always be a major concern, cyber-attacks continue to grow exponentially and show no sign of stopping or slowing.</p>
<p>The impact of this is loss of data and monetary loss, not only can a large company lose a massive amount of money to a Ransome ware
attack but can loos private data that could be leaked to media or public resulting in what could be irreparable reputation loss.</p>
<p>Cyber security attacks especially in the cloud computing sector will continue to grow, as more and more cloud computing is becoming the new normal. 
This has been accelerated by covid19 as more and more businesses are jumping on the cloud computing band wagon. At this point it’s not so much a matter 
of if but when and how you recover.</p>
<p>The most vulnerable people to this are businesses and their reputation, if a large medical firm was to lose medical records this could spell 
disaster, no one would want to store their data with this organization again. One of these large Organizations or governments could be hit with a ransomware 
attack that could cost them millions, imaging a situation where your organization has lost 1 million or more personal records, bank details names credit card 
numbers, now you are being told pay up or else. Most companies without a backup plan could be in for a lot of trouble and won’t have a legal leg to stand on 
because many organized criminal cyber hacking groups are government sanctioned. That’s right governments worldwide are paying people to do this, sometimes 
for monetary gain sometimes for political gain.</p>
<p>Cyber security stands to create many more jobs soon not only for new people willing
to put in the efforts and gain the qualification, but for old hats too who are
willing to upgrade their certifications, it is certainly not a job sector that
is going away any time soon.</p>

<h2>Cyber Security - How will this effect you </h2>
<p>Technology has become increasingly important in our lives and this large reliance will make us more exposed to cybercrime in terms
 of data security and privacy such as hacking, malware, identity theft, financial fraud, medical information, and other offences that
 expose our personal information, messages, images and video and audio recordings without our approval or permission.</p>
<p>In the next few years, cybersecurity will gain increasing importance as our society and life becomes more technologically dependent. 
Identifiable information such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, and bank account numbers are publicly displayed on social media accounts. 
Cloud storage services like Dropbox and Google Drive are now used to store sensitive information such as social security numbers, credit card numbers,
 and bank account numbers.</p>
<p>Personally, I use the cloud storage from Google Drive, Google photos, Google Document, and all other Google services to save and keep my personal data, 
 my folders and my family and friends photos and videos and that’s help me to restore them whatever my mobile have problem or even buy a new one.
 As well as I use Google Drive to sync my RMIT subjects and assessment and without a cybersecurity program, my data and personal information 
 will be irresistible target for cybercriminals. </p>
<p>Cybersecurity will allow me to protect and recover my computer system, network, devices, and the programs from any type of cyber-attack. 
 It will protect my data, folders, photos and videos and all other categories of data from theft and damage. This includes sensitive data, 
 personally identifiable information, and my personal information. </p>
<p>As a student I can’t have a dedicated cybersecurity team, the cybercriminals may easily attack my computer and devices, that will make my data vulnerable
 to cyberattacks including data theft and ransomware. Most of my family members and friends aren’t aware of the risk of cyber-attacks, 
 they use their devices daily in their life, the usage of these devices alone makes them vulnerable to these attacks.</p>
<p>These malware programs are often disguised by cybercriminals and sold in official app stores, where they blend into legitimate apps seamlessly 
and the users aren’t aware of the threats posed by these cyber-attacks. </p>

<h2 id="Cloud">Clouds, Services, Servers. What do they do?.</h2>
<p>Cloud services is set to become the new norm world over, and arguably already is.</p>
<p>So what is the cloud? VOX.com quotes it as.</p>
<blockquote>“The cloud refers to software and services that run on the Internet, instead of locally on your computer.”<BR>
Bonnie Cha of VOX.com</blockquote>
<p>The Cloud is a digital landscape made up of millions of servers, pc’s and infrastructure worldwide. The services the cloud supplies include but is certainly 
not limited to are, Facebook, Messenger, Email, Apple ICloud, Google Drive. These services operate in this landscape. When you watch that YouTube video its coming 
to you from not just one hard drive in one location, that video could be coming to you in bits pulled together by the YouTube servers from all over the world to 
send you that complete content.</p>
<p>The Cloud sits in a constant state of “State of the art”, this is due to the non centralized nature of the cloud. Cloud services have done away with the need 
to local infrastructure to do your computing both personally and for business. The Cloud is made up of millions or more, of computers called servers all around the 
world in massive data centres. These data centres always have the most up to date cutting edge technology, if they didn’t they would be able to compete in this now 
cut throat industry. What’s a data centre <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfvbCggY_nI">Click Here</a> for a great video.</p>
<p>Cloud services can bring you content from around the world, but the cloud is capable of so much more. Some organisations and governments are leveraging the huge 
amount of computing power behind the cloud to perform incredible data calculations, this usually falls into a few processing buckets, Machine Learning is a major 
benefactor of this performing power. Machine learning is as the name suggests, the feed a computer algorithm massive amounts of data and then the algorithm runs 
thousands if not millions of simulations based on that data, the algorithm is told whats bad and what’s good then the algorithm gets to work learning from its 
mistakes with each interation, until a desired outcome is reached. This can include prediction of stocks, weather based on past trends, even identifying peoples of 
interest in real time, prediction of movement of people in high foot traffic areas.</p>
<p>With the ability to leverage huge amounts of computing power, we will see a future where that heavy metal box on your desktop could be a thing of the past. 
In 3 years of less we could see virtualization services move from just being a corporate service to the become a service used by private PC users too. It already 
appears to be an attractive prospect, why pay nearly $2k for a gaming PC when you could rent a virtual PC in the cloud for a fraction of the cost billed monthly 
instead of a lump sum. Due to the online nature of this Virtualized PC, you could literally log into it from almost any web enabled device, Your phone, tv, even 
your web enabled car (Future Tech), could possibly be your pc on the run. The best part of these virtualized machines is you don’t need to decide what hardware you 
want now, due to the virtual nature of these you just pay for a better tier with more CPU cores and ram. Tresorio offers this already check out their website 
<a href="https://tresorio.com/en/blog/tutorial-cloud-gaming/">Click Here</a></p> 
<p>We will also see a future where machine learning and AI becomes so powerful leveraging off the back of the cloud, that we may not be able to tell the difference 
between a human and a AI. Or we may find the human race in a situation where AI’s will have rights and deleting a hard drive could be considered murder of a intelligent being.</p>

<h2>Cloud, services, server and its potential impact</h2>
<p>With the spread of cloud, services, server, companies were encouraged to outsource most of their IT needs. 
Third-party vendors will invest in hardware and software and make technology -based serviced available to businesses online. 
Instead of a company paying for a its IT department to be upgraded regularly, they can purchase cloud services as needed. 
This type of outsourcing reduced the upfront investment in technology that was required to enter the new market and or to stay relevant. 
By using cloud services, a small business can offer the same customer service interface as a large business and deliver a product that delivers the same quality 
to customers. The cloud, services and servers have also positive impact on the economics of these businesses. It provides many economic incentives and 
other benefits that can help enhance the company’s total value and revenue and help saves cost, with minimal money spent on training employees</p>
<p>Reduced cost is the greatest impact about moving to the cloud services. This also eliminates the need for server hardware because everything is 
available and hosted on the cloud server and this helps reduce hardware costs and helps with new innovations.</p>
<p>In addition, the company can quickly increase or decrease their operating and storage requirements, with the use of the cloud services the business will not 
have to buy expensive updates for every machine, the cloud, services, server’s provider will manage this for the business. Thus, it will have impact on the 
deployment of the project which means the cloud-based applications take less time to achieve the set goal, most cloud applications can be downloaded immediately 
upon registration, and the cloud provides fast application deployment. Due to the availability of the cloud services on the internet, it enables employees to
 access files from anywhere in the world at any time and allows them to work remotely, this reduces office space expenses. </p>
<p>Though, there is a negative affect this can be dependency on the cloud, services, server. The service supplier can impose complete dependence on the 
 service to access your data stored on their servers.  If something was to go wrong or the service requested you pay a higher price for your service, 
 due to the closed environment nature of these cloud services getting your data back could be difficult if not impossible.</p>
<p>There is also a risk of loss of data when your system and software are uploaded to the cloud because the cloud, services, server are not 
 able to provide all the needs of the user. This can be compounded with lack of technical knowledge and experience in dealing with the software, 
 this makes data loss more likely and can make life very difficult for users who aren’t so adept with current technologies.</p>
<p>The adoption of this technology in the future will affect the labour market in information technology. Job seekers who have experience working with
 cloud-based services will have an advantage, along with people who are flexible enough to weather the transition to greater reliance on 
 third-party partnerships.</p>

<h2>Clouds, services, servers How will this affect you?</h2>
<p>Cloud, services, and servers work together to enable me to access data anywhere and at any time. I can enrol online and participate in online learning activities. 
Cloud computing has enabled RMIT to use the storage cloud to store large amounts of data securely and share it with me.<BR>
I can live stream my favourite movies on Netflix because of cloud, services, and servers. I can also look for friends I have spoken to for many years or friends I 
talk to daily on services, but with the service development of social networks like Facebook and Instagram, it's much easier to connect with friends and people 
through the online community.<BR>
Whenever I drive somewhere I use my phone for navigation for example, google maps. Cloud, servers, and services has enabled these navigation programs to store large 
amounts of data and regularly update it to assist us. Whenever I use these tools, I indirectly utilizing the cloud to travel form one place to another, and it prevents 
me from getting lost and finding the fastest route.</p>
<p>After reading about Clouds, services, and servers I now realise how important they are to the world, especially the security side of things. If we are going to use 
Clouds, services, and servers we all must learn about security, or our sensitive data can be accessed and cause a lot of problems. When we access certain sensitive data 
it’s a great idea to enable a VPN which hides your IP from hackers and protects your data while accessing it. Another great security measure is creating very strong 
passwords and never use the same password for more than one service. After securing your data in the cloud and services it is the most efficient and fasts way to send 
and receive data.</p>
<p>My grandparents still live in the past where they send everything via post which is the most unsecure way of sending personal information. Information sent via post 
can be accessed from basic theft, while sending information via the cloud is encrypted making it very difficult for people to steal. After mentioning this system to my 
Grandparents, they wanted to experience the new ways of managing personal data and learning more about how far Clouds, service, and servers have come to make the world 
a better and more efficient place.</p>

<h2 id="MachineLearning">Machine Learning What does it do?.</h2>
<p>Machine Learning is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence. In simple terms it is the act of teaching computers to make accurate guesses when given data. Three categories of Machine learning are: Model Optimisation Process, Decision Process and Error Functions. Model Optimisation Processing is where the algorithm compares a training set of data to the model estimate. From there factors are adjusted to closer match the model to the training data, correcting each test as needed to optimise the process until a certain level of accuracy has been met. Error Functions serve to evaluate predictions within the model. If given examples the algorithm can use this as a comparison to guess how accurate the model will be. Finally, there is Decision Process, this is the act of giving the algorithm data and having it give an estimate relating to patterns in the data.
Self-driving vehicles are one of the most state of the art feats of Machine Learning. Without Machine Learning, vehicles would not be able to interpret signs or images, and thus would not be able to tell what speed to travel at or when to stop. The way this is done is using cameras and sensors, taking in the information constantly to work out how to operate safely. It is undoubtedly the foundation for allowing vehicles to operate without human intervention.
As it stands Machine Learning can be used for a variety of things, including Commute Estimation. An easy example of this is in Google Maps, where smartphone location data is used to predict journey times as well as providing alternative routes if there is a quicker option available. Another example of modern Machine Learning is in Social Networks, where Facebook uses facial recognition to automatically suggest what friends to tag when uploading photos. One of the most amazing uses of Machine Learning is in medical diagnosis. It has been used to accurately diagnose breast cancer in patients by combining the power of Machine Learning with Deep Learning. This technology was developed in the 90’s, however back then the algorithm did not provide a significant increase in positive detections and as such it wasn’t used as widely and nor was the technology advanced further. In more recent years this technique has seen an increase in interest and use, which has led to an advancement in the capabilities of Machine Learning being used in Medical Imaging as a whole.
In the coming years Machine Learning is going to become increasing part of our everyday lives. As technology is becoming more advanced, the way in which we can train it and even what we can train it to do will become streamlined. We may or may not see more breakthroughs like we have seen in the likes of autonomous cars (, but we will see a change in how we use technology to assist with productivity. Things like Speech and Gesture recognition will become more commonplace. The use of Machine Learning in professional environments will see an uptake as well, every workforce will see the technologies they use, as well as their processes become more powerful and efficient. 
Machine Learning is made possible from learning algorithms and the data that they are given. The data is given to the algorithm for it to learn, it examines the data to know what information to retain. From there the algorithm can analyse new data and compare it with the knowledge it has. This all sounds incredibly involved, and it is, however you do not need a massively powerful computer to deploy Machine Learning. Consumer grade hardware can provide everything you need if you choose the right components.</p>
<h2>Machine Learning and its potential impact</h2>
<p>Machine Learning will lead to a world where most things can be automated. The way we work, live and play will all be altered with the ongoing advancement. Work will become a much more streamlined process, where it may be as simple as starting a task for a program or algorithm to complete certain tasks for you. Machines will certainly take a step closer to becoming co-workers as they become more advanced. At home devices that benefit from Machine Learning already exist (such as a Home Assistant) and though they can help with basic tasks right now, we are sure to see more advanced devices introduced to help with home living in the coming years.
Everyone be affected either directly or indirectly as machine learning becomes more widely adopted. Teaching robots and programs to do tasks for people will increase our ease of living. Humans will have more time in their daily lives to do the things they would rather do and even have even more assistance when doing it. Everything from a simple task such as turning on a light, to more complex tasks like driving will be made easier and more accessible for everyone, helping make those with disabilities live lives with less challenges.
This will have a massive impact on what jobs are available for people however, machines that have been taught tasks through Machine Learning will occupy more of the workforce. The positive aspect is that there will be opportunities for people to pursue roles making machine learning better and better which will also open new roles in almost every IT field. Outside of the IT field, there will still be jobs that people can do meaning that we will not be forced to only take one career path, we will still have the option to explore working environments and see what we like.</p>
<h2>Machine Learning How will this affect you?</h2>
<p>This will affect me personally through many ways. My current job could become more automated or even to the point of taking over my job. Machines have a lot of potential in taking over labor jobs and my job is making sandwiches at subway. If robots were to be developed that could make a sandwich without the help of a human employee, then I could be replaced. Although it could affect my current job, my desired IT job could open new opportunities due to the development of robotics. I could work in robotic/machine related areas to help develop them. If machines were developed then I might consider a different career path in IT due to the new opportunities presenting themselves. For my family that works with cars will have to learn new things about cars in relation to machine learning. This has been seen with the development of computer systems in new cars. If the development of car technology continues my family will have to be able to fix the computer systems in cars if people have problems with them. My older family might struggle to keep up with the development and understanding how it all works. This means they might exclude it from their lives or be forced but struggle to learn. My other family and friends do not really have jobs in areas that could be replaced by machines but if machines learning does develop to a large scale, then it could potentially affect their daily life. For example, if self-driving cars develop then they will have to learn how they work as well as implement it in their daily lives. Machine learning has so many possibilities and potential to change everyone’s lives whether that be with their job or just around the house in their daily lives. Mostly machine learning development would have positive impact for my family, friends, and I.</p>

<h2 id= "Robots">Robots What does it do?.</h2>
<p>Robots are ever evolving and not limited to size, capability or design which makes them hard to define. Many experts will debate the term “robot” as it can encompass simple 
contraptions, such as thermostats, to much larger projects, such as Atlas built by Boston Dynamics. There are many discrepancies between the true definition. It is best 
summarised as to whether it is sensing, analysing/ computing and acting. All robots will be fitted with a type of sensor in which it takes a reading from. From that reading it 
will analyse and compute the best course of action for its purpose. Finally taking that data the robot will act on it, in the case of a thermostat it may lower the heating. The 
state-of-the-art technology at the moment would be robots such as Atlas from Boston Dynamics. They have engineered a humanoid robot that can dance, jump and carry things. This 
is all possible with the use of many sensors around the robot. Atlas uses these sensors to then calculate how to balance or which step to take next. All things that the human 
body does instinctually. However, because Atlas is a robot and is able to calculate things much more accurately than a human. Many things are possible with current technology. 
Most robots are found in factories, replacing repetitive jobs of their human counter-part. Car manufacturers were some of the first places to incorporate such robots. They do a 
singular task on an assembly line to build a finished product. Humans are still required to watch and make sure that nothing goes wrong, but for the most part these robots are 
autonomous. The benefit for the uses of these robots is that there is less of a chance for human error with products, fatigue or accidents. Removing humans from these 
environments, although it lowers the employment rates in these factories, it improves efficiency and product quality. Other robots have more autonomy, like self-driving cars or 
the mars rover. The mars rover was partially controlled by humans but the parts that worked off of autonomy would collect samples and data. Sending that information back to 
Earth. It would have made countless calculation far faster than any human could. Having travelled so far as well it gave us invaluable information about space. Roombas or 
automated vacuum cleaners are a small simple example of a robot. It is capable of sensing its surroundings and avoids obstacles. Some models are even capable of sensing the 
difference between carpet and hardwood. In the future a lot of companies are looking to create robots that can cook and clean for people. Models are being worked on currently 
and are capable of a set few menu items. However, the current models are too dangerous and expensive to sell to people. Creating better robots for future space and ocean 
exploration as well. Space and the ocean have very similar requirements for their robots. They need to be able to survive the conditions, collect samples, pictures and relay 
them back to their human controller. They would be well equipped with many sensors to help navigation and the ability to correct its own position if it is stuck. The 
technological advances that are necessary to make these advancements are mostly mechanical. Things like battery capacity, have been a long running problem with all devices 
that aren’t plugged into a wall. Finding something capable of holding more energy that takes up the least amount of space with a decent half-life. Developing AI systems that 
can learn faster and are able to compute more things unassisted by humans. All of these developments are crucial to further our technological advancements. <BR>

<h2>Robots and its potential impact</h2>

<h2>Robots how it will afffect you</h2>
<p>Autonomous machines have taken up many labour jobs. However, in my current employment I work with robotic arms that move molten glass to create glass discs. 
We also have robots that move those glass disc samples into an x-ray machine. From which it processes the minerals present in the glass. 
All of this was previously done manually, and still is for very special samples, but has cut down analysis time and potential risks on employees. 
Directly, very little has affected me with the introduction of robots in the assembly line industry but it definitely has made my job easier. 
I am less likely to get into accidents or burn myself handling something over 100 degrees. Indirectly, however, there have been cheaper prices for mass produced goods. 
This is due to the fact that these products no longer require a human to be paid per hour, and robots do not require sleep to function so factories are able to run through the night at the same capacity. 
With the lowering of price however there is a cost in quality as most assembly line robots do not possess the same problem-solving skills as a human worker. 
This can lead to inferior products which can be quite frustrating as a consumer. It is very easy to get sucked into buying a cheaper but lower quality product which I often find myself doing. 
I think with the advancements in technology there is a potential for me to lose my current job. However, with the rate that the current analysis machines break down and require technicians to fix I do not think I am in any particular jeopardy yet. 
For my family I also do not think that the move to fully automate production lines will affect them in any way they would notice. As my family work in sectors that require a high emotional quotient they will not be affected in their daily jobs. 
I believe the only things that it will affect is the amount of money spend on products. </p>

<!-- Project Idea -->
<div ID="ProjectIdea">
<h1> Our Project Idea </h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Coop’s project idea will be about an app to assist people who have recently moved into their own home. This could be either for the first time or to help with anything around the home they are not confident in.</p>
<p>As a team we have listed some ideas as to what the app will contain. It will have information that ranges from explaining how to carry out simple tasks such as gardening to difficult tasks like fixing a leaking tap. In addition to house maintenance features, there will be features to help with day-to-day life like cooking and also specialty things such as writing a resume and cover letter.<br>
We decided this would be a great project because we want to make life a little easier at home and help people save money by giving them the information needed to.</p>

<h2> Description of the Project </h2>
<p>The app will have various categories that relate to everyday homes. Each category will have many different sections that the user will be able to select. The sections will expand to a list of problems. When the user selects a problem there will be a page outlining the issues with multiple solutions and with a detail step by step guide. There will also be multiple tabs that can be selected.<br>
First will be the overview of the problem which will include the solutions and additional information in written format (includes pictures as well).<br>
The second tab will be a video tutorial on how to solve the problem. The information present in the overview/solution and video tab will be outsourced from recommended sources with acknowledgement to respected sources.<br>
The last tab will be a discussion/forum page for users to discuss and be able to provide additional information or seek help from moderators or other users.</p>
<p>The app will also include a suggestion component that will allow users to contact the app moderators with ideas for current issues that they want addressed or to provide addition solutions to already existing problems. If a user wishes to post in forums or provide suggestions, they will have to create an account by either using google account or using their email. Creating account will allow users to create a profile for themselves as well in the profile section. The user profile will include; profile pictures, usernames, description, and user ratings.<br>
The user ratings system will be a user interactive system between the community. Users will be able to rate other user’s helpfulness on individual forum posts. Each user will also be able to view profiles of other users which will also link them to all their forum post.<br>
The forum post will be organised in the categories which users can select to be directed to the post. All forum post will be managed with profanity filtering AI (Artificial Intelligence) as well as being monitored by moderators regularly. If a user has a problem another user’s post, they can report that user on that user's profile page. The report will be sent to the moderators and thank the user for submitting the report.</p>
<p>Under the profile on the side bar will be a settings tab. Settings will include: account, language, display, User agreement, privacy policy, content policy, help centre, report an issue, and build information. The account section will allow users that are not logged in to login which will lead to a sign in page that can also be used to create an account or to recover forgotten information. If the user is logged in then the profile tab will allow them to logout or change their password (if selected leading to a password reset screen). The language tab is to change the app language to any language. Display tab will let user’s change to dark or light mode. The policy tabs will let the user view each different policies or agreements in their entirely. The report an issue section is for users to report problems with the app’s technical abilities.</p>
<p>In our app there will be several sections to cover all aspects of home living and maintenance. The main category will be home living. Within this category there will be the following subsections. Plumbing, this will encompass tutorials for basic maintenance such as why there is no water coming from your tap, why you hear a loud noise when turning the tap on, fixing leaking appliances (such as taps,water meters or toilets), no hot water coming from your tap, how to fix blocked drains (recommended chemicals, methods, etc.) and why there is no water going to the cistern. Etc. </p>
<p>In this category there will be tutorials on how to clean the house and your clothes. There will be a subcategory with tutorials on how to remove intense stains from whites and how to operate a washing machine and maintaining it. The other subcategory contains tutorials on what chemicals to use and how to use them on showers, bathtubs, basins, and toilets to get the best results. The third subcategory will contain tutorials on how to clean all types of floors; Marble, Tiles, Hardwood, Bamboo, carpet and how to clean all the dirt from the grout between tiles making the floor look brand new. The last subcategory will contain information about how to clean and maintain your appliances, for example; Fridges, dishwashers, and washing machines. </p>
<p>While most are familiar with everyday tech, sometimes there are a few things that are easy to miss, like what cable goes where when connection a surround system. This section is to help with that by giving the user helpful information and videos for diagnosing minor tech issues. In this section we would like to cover basic pc skills too, such as cleaning and caring for your pc i.e. how to effectively clean a keyboard and mouse, how to check the heatsinks are clean on some pcs, and minor upgrade procedures such as replacing ram, Graphics cards and so forth. (A lot of links to Linus)</p>
<p>The app will also include a cooking section which will include recipes, food storage hacks and essential utensils for the kitchen. For each recipe, the user can change the portion sizes and find where they are able to purchase these ingredients by using an embedded grocery store interface. Through this you can compare prices and if you can buy it at that store. Alongside this we will advertise people’s recipes for a monthly subscription. If an applicable video is available, it will also be embedded into the tutorials. Sub sections for recipes will be added to make it easier to navigate and find applicable recipes for the right occasion. Sub sections such as family meals, student friendly recipes, special occasions etc. Another sub section for food storage hacks that would contain; how to store fresh fruit and vegetables, useful tools for the kitchen and what containers to use. This section will detail both cost effective ways as well as environmentally friendly options. Overall, the purpose for this category is to assist with making cooking and prepping an easier task and promote a healthy personal interest.</p>
<p>The section for resumes and interviews will cover the ideal way to write a resume along with how to style it. It will include things such as what skills you should include, how to format your qualifications and previous work history and who to include as references. The interviews portion will give some examples questions of what may be asked in an interview to help you prepare, as well as suggestions of what type of attire to wear depending on the kind of job you are going for.</p>
<h2>Outdoor maintenance</h2> 
<p>	Will contain equipment, machines, and chemicals you might need to maintain your garden and pools.
    <br>
	These are some tools and machines used to maintain your garden:
	 <ul>
	    <li>Hoses for watering the garden.</li>
		<li>Spades for planting trees and flowers.</li>
		<li>Rakes for gathering and cleaning leaves.</li>
		<li>Hedge trimmer to cut back bushes.</li>
		<li>Lawn mower for cutting the grass.</li>
	    <li>Whipper snipper is used to support the lawn mower in cutting grass in awkward spots.</li>
        <li>Mulcher to cut up trees to produce mulch that protects soil moisture, prevents weeds from growing and improving fertility and health of the soil.</li>
	 </ul>
</p>
<p>Another category that will be added is about maintain your pool. The first thing you must do daily is skim the surface of your pool which takes about ten minutes and keeps the water clean. It is important to remove leaves and dirt from the surface of the water, so it doesn't sink to the bottom and stain the pool floor. Once the dirt has been brushed from the walls to the floor, they can be then vacuumed by an automatic pool vacuum, along with any other dirt that has floated from the surface to the bottom and always keep your filtration system running to clean thew water. Lastly regularly check the chemicals in the pool to make sure no bacteria are growing.</p>

<h2>Pets</h2>
<p>There will be a category on how to take care of a household pets, for example, cat, dog, and hamster. This will contain scheduling of how often they are required to be fed to make sure they stay fit and healthy and how to groom and essentially take care of them if need be. There will be a list of products you can buy like toys and essentials as well. The app will provide links to websites on how to train your pet to listen to you and behave more appropriately around the house for example, potty training.</p>
<p>The Glossary will be where you can go to look up terminology for anything you fully understand so you can read a brief definition of it. You will be able to get to this section either by selecting it from the menu, or by pressing highlighted terms within the subject you are reading about. You will be able to tell what words are in the glossary when you are reading as the word will be coloured differently from the rest of the text and underlined as well.</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>The outcome of our app project being successful will mean that people are having success in solving household problems through our app. The original problem will be solved as people will be able to solve their household problems without paying for someone to come fix it for them. This could lead to people saving a lot of money as well as expand their knowledge on the area in which they sought help in. The success of the app will also help with developing the app further as it is fueled by the community as much as the developers. The community that can come from the success of the app will mean that other solutions for multiple problems can be created through feedback. Additionally, an interactive community will help the app thrive and allow innovation in new ideas to expand the app. If the app shows major success, then it will be able to have more moderation and updates at a regular rate. </p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>The motivation behind creating this app is to provide easy access to people with general problems with home related topics. The idea is that there are many problems that people face with their home that could be fixed without spending money on services to fix it for you. In our discussion of creating this project idea we found that we all had experiences with different household issues. The issues we faced were issues that could be solved on our own with some googling and trial and error. Although google presents multiple solutions for these issues it is sometimes hard to find solutions for the specific problem without going through so many irrelevant sources. Our app is aimed to present these problems in an easy to access environment with extra discussion between people that have faced similar situations. Due to the growth of technology and the changes to how our generation learns, the app aims to thrive on the new ways of learning targeted at younger generations that are first home owners that haven’t learnt how to solve some problems in their home as well as problems with newer technology or aspects. </p>

<h2>Tools & Tech</h2>
<p>To make our app we need tools, there are many programs that can be used to make apps in both Android and Apple. With the way this app will function we will probably require multiple programs to help use. There doesn’t appear to be many that do it all. After some research I would suggest the following programs.</p>
<p>Appery although not free has a lot of features and is probably a good starting point, Appery will make interfacing and setting up the online database’s required for this project much easier. Appery how ever is not free and is used to make very functional but boring interfaces.</p>
<p>We need a good-looking interface, our target audience will already have a very short attention span and a boring interface would just be a deal breaker. This is where Mobile Roadie will shine, although not very technical it does give a lot more control of interface look and feel.</p>
<p>This can all be accomplished using the native Android and Apple studios, but the interfaces for these are quite complex and usually require a lot of coding skill.</p>
<p>Cloud services, although most of our app will link to handy article, we still want the function for users to communicate in a form style interface and suggest items for our app, to do this the app will need to interface with a database to get this information to display. This is where we need a cloud computing service of some description or possibly multiple.</p>
<p>And finaly we need the hardware to program thins on, although most of our team members have computers, and some of these programs such as Appery are cloud based.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>In order to make a effective app we need some skills, Coding, Art, Interface, Perception, all these can be called Design Skill.</p>
<p>Coding, even though most programs for making apps have templates we still need to do some coding, to either add a online feature or just to change something the template doesn’t suit for our app.</p>
<p>Art, this makes up most of the interface the user sees, without interesting icons, wallpapers or features the app will just look like a glorified spreadsheet and no user wants that.</p>
<p>Interface, this is arguably the most important feature of a app. The interface is what the user sees and a well done interface can be the difference between a good and bad app. But its not just the look it’s the feel, image a interface where everything is just 2 to 3 taps away, is easy to read, clearly stated, easy to find, looks great and doesn’t get tiresome to use. Now think of a interface that looks great but takes 8 taps to change you profile picture, features that you use on a daily basis hiding inside a menu in a menu in a menu, so many buttons icons and text that you need glass’s to see it, that’s a bad interface. The user shouldn’t have to work to use your app, it should feel natural like second nature.</p>
<p>Perception, we need to have to foresight to know what a user will like. If we have to release 10 updates to make a app useable, then by the time that happens it already has a bad score on the store and no one cares anymore. Foresight is paramount without it you might as well not bother.</p>
<p>How are we going to get these skills? Training there are plenty of free and paid for online courses that cover all these skills. There should be no reason why anyone couldn’t make their own apps, you just need to put the effort and research in.</p>

<div ID="GroupReflection">
<h1>Group Reflection</h1>
<p>In addition to our individual reflection, we did meat up as a team as well to discuss the points we reflected on.</p>
<h2>What went well</h2>
<p>At the start of the project, we found it very easy to get along which made the assignment smooth sailing throughout the 4 weeks. With great teamwork helping each other out when we need it most or Connor teaching the group how to use GitHub and effective communication, the coop was able to complete the assignment before due date. The team demonstrated fantastic communication and accountability, writing down meetings into the calendar so people know when they meetings are, creating detailed tasks for the most appropriate group member preventing arguments and disagreements, posting valuable information in posts on Microsoft teams reminding people what tasks needs to be completed and reminders for meetings. All thanks to Connor we had a great filing system keeping everything organised and easy to access, this reflected on most of the team and now everyone is doing their best to keep the assignment organised.</p>
<h2>What could be improved</h2>
<p>For most of the assignment our group was a well-oiled machine, there were however a few little bumps along the way. Everyone in the group has a very easy-going nature and though this is not a bad thing, it did lead to a lack of initiative when it came to putting our hands up for selecting tasks to complete and also lead to an inequal workload. The lack of initiative also led to team meetings not always having equal involvement from all members as we would sometimes wait for others to speak before speaking ourselves. When it came to team meetings, there was also a punctuality issue with people showing up to the meeting late, or not showing up at all, though this did not occur all the time. The only other real issue was with attentiveness. There were times we would find ourselves getting side-tracked from the task at hand, usually going on a tangent to talk about a completely unrelated topic. Attentiveness was also sometimes lacking when it came to keeping up to date with posts and requests people in the team had put forward, potentially accidentally going unread.</p>
<h2>At least one thing that was surprising</h2>
<p>As a group, we were surprised and delighted to find that everyone brought a passion to the table as well as an amazing attitude, not only professionally but also outside of the assignment, we didn’t need to be professional at every second to accomplish our assignment. While some people may find joking around to be a negative aspect, we believe that it helped strengthen us as a team. Despite the fact that before the start of this assignment none of us had ever met, we managed to come together to form a strong team who could openly voice our opinions or concerns knowing that we will be heard and everything we say will be taken onboard.</p>
<h2>At least one thing that you have learned about groupwork</h2>
<p>The team has learned to organised assignment 2 files in a professional manner making it simple to locate and edit files to then be sent off to GitHub which is all new to the team. We have worked out that we don’t have to baby sit each other (communicating every hour) we have learnt to trust each other with the work we’ve chose and to push each other with a set timeframe to give the group extra reassurance.  Feeling reliant on your team can boost morale to get the work done faster in a more confident manner. We have also gathered outside of university hours to get to know each other more and build a solid relationship which also boosts morale for the team.</p>
<br>
<h1>Personal Group Reflections</h1>
<p>Towards the end of the assessment, we each took the time to reflect on our work and also our team, and the various aspects of this assessment and this is how we felt about it.</p>
<h2>Daisy’s Reflection</h2>
<p>For assessment 2 I was nervous about the amount of effort people were interested in putting in and whether we would mesh well as a team. I think like most projects it was a slow start. We got to know each other better and bonded as a team. I think we communicated well and tried our best to not disappoint each other. There definitely was a closer group of people in a team which I felt work both with against us. It definitely helped the majority of people work hard because we liked each other and didn’t want to bring each other down but it also lead to us isolating 2 team members, which is something I’d like to improve on our upcoming assessment. We definitely out performed a lot of teams that weren’t as lucky with selecting team mates. Our team was mostly proficient in communication, organisation, team work, diversity and problem solving. In most cases it was the 2 team mates that were shy that did not always have the chance to speak up or correctly communicate important information. In future I will try to split up the meeting chair role to try and get more inclusivity and organisation from all team members.</p>
<h2>Callum’s Reflection</h2>
<p>From the word go, our team was able to connect and work efficiently with each other. Open communication was never an issue and everyone was able to get along. If anyone needed help in any capacity, be it they did not understand what needed to be done or just needed help with their workload, there no was no hesitation to ask because we knew that everyone would be willing to help.</p>
<p>Our team works amazingly together and we even communicate in our free time, this has led us to getting easily distracted. This is not a massive issue, nor is it enough to raise an actual complaint, it has eaten into our assignment time more than I would have like it to.</p>
<p>Previous when I have had to work in a group, I knew everyone I was working with. It has really surprised me just how well a group of strangers can come together, get along and collaborate on a joint project and how easy the entire process has been.</p>
<p>The main thing I have learned from being in this group is that working in a team who take the time to get to know each other is the best and easiest way to form a team that has a strong bond from initial stages.</p>
<h2>Brandon’s Reflection</h2>
<p>I was very pleased with the group I was with. Their work ethic and orgainsation was very helpful for me and positively impacted my performance for this assignment. We were also very affable and likeable so it was very easy for us to communicate with one another and present ideas that were encouraged and accepted. We could have improved on being more assertive or taking more initiative when deciding what tasks would be assigned to who. The thing that surprised me the most was the eagerness to do well in this assessment from everyone involved. I also was surprised how well we all got along with one another. Everyone is very likeable and share common interests and humor which made it easier to work together as we were able to spend time with each other outside of meetings. I expected some issues with communication of the work division but this was not the case at all. Everyone was willing to do work and provide help at all times available. I have learnt how to be more effective and organisation through my group as it is a weak point I have. I have also learnt from everyone’s eagerness to contribute and speak to also not be scared to present ideas as well as when completing a task to look for others thoughts and ideas for my task.</p>
<h2>Connor’s Reflection</h2>
<p>The group went swimmingly, despite my self-imposed limitations and doubts I was pleasantly surprised to find that the team got alone very well.</p>
<p>I was truly under the impression that due to the age gap; I would come across as the old man. I must admit I have had a great time doing this project with our team and am looking forward to working with them further.</p>
<p>Daisy our leader, almost seems to be born to lead. Branden although quite he certainly doesn’t mess about when asked to do something. Callum our resident crazy, although a good worker has concentration issues. Michael and quality go’s hand and hand, Michael is incredibly dependable. Nemat very quiet by nature, but an amazing person who has shown true talent and never turns a task down.</p>
<p>I have learnt that a group doesn’t need to be 100% professional to achieve a goal, turns out you can have fun and still accomplish greatness.</p>
<p>The only downside I saw was the improper use of the tools we had at hand i.e., Teams. For this I take a bit of responsibility this software was new to most of the team, but I have been using teams professionally for Years. Next time I take a more proactive approach to the administration in the Teams environment.</p>
<h2>Nemat’s Reflection</h2>
<p>Our group is an effective group, everyone has done contributions to the group assessment in a professional way and on time. We all had the same goal to avoid delay and achieve the highest level of the work. We worked effectively together. We understood each of our strengths and made sure they were used. One very good aspect was the communication between each other. We were talking and discussing each task out of the formal time. Everyone was helpful and offers help if anyone ask for it. We did our work bringing them together to create something more powerful than any of us done it individually. The one thing that surprised me is how we communicate and manage our time to be in the same progress. In addition, how everyone was doing their best with passion and in perfect way. The good point was not to be rush into doing the tasks and spend good time to get a perfect work in the end. I learnt how to become more effective and how to work in a group environment. This was a successful team, and no major change is needed and can use this experience to be enhancing the effectiveness for our next assessment.</p>
<h2>Michael’s Reflection</h2>
<p>At the start of the project, we found it very easy to get along which made the assignment smooth sailing throughout the 4 weeks. With great teamwork helping each other out when we need it most or Connor teaching the group how to use GitHub and effective communication, the coop was able to complete the assignment before due date.</p>
<p>I think myself and some members of the group should take more initiative to put their hand up for work instead of someone else handing out work. It shows that you’re interested and keen to learn. I have noticed that the team’s attention span is very short and easily broken away from the assignment.</p>
<p>From past experiences with group projects, it was hard to have a voice to share ideas, but I felt I could share anything when working with the coop which made me feel included. Another thing I noticed was that everyone got along at a personal level making it easier to communicate to each other, I was expecting the group would only speak to one another when they had to, but we all became friends.</p>
<p>I have learnt that the stress levels of carrying out an assignment as a group is different to writing up an assignment by yourself. When working in a group we must rely on our team to produce quality work in a certain time frame and sometimes it can be stressful when your team member falls behind schedule and you’re relying on them to hand in their part. </p>
