<p align=left>Our Team is The Coop. The name comes from our original idea of a coop to monitor chickens; however, we have found that it still fits for our new project (luckily for us as we really liked the name originally).<br>
Our team consists of six people whom you can read about in the <a href="#PersonalProfiles">Personal Profiles</a> section.</p>

<h1>Personal Profiles</h1>
<p><b>Brandon Lopresti – S3921161 - S3921161@student.rmit.edu.au.</b> I was born in Australia with a family background of Italian heritage. My past education is only that of high school and I have started taking an interest in IT therefore taking this course. I only speak one language, English. My hobbies include basketball, gaming, and media in general. I have been interested in IT for as long as I can remember. My childhood was in a time where technology was developing at such a fast rate. I started playing video games at a very young age and transitioning into high school I got my very first laptop. When I got my first laptop my interest to learn IT grew and I found myself seeking out information about how it all works. I love the creativity of technology and how limitless it seems. The team I will be working with is The Coop. Everyone a part of The Coop shows such enthusiasm and drive to do well as well to help one another. I am very glad to have them a part of my group making this experience super easy. </p> 
<p><b>Callum Lambeth - S3921235 - S3921235@student.rmit.edu.au.</b> I was born and raised in Queensland and I moved to Melbourne in 2017. From a young age, all hardware has been able to grab my attention. I have loved seeing how things work, pulling them apart, mostly by pulling them apart and putting them back together. When I got to high school and learning about software became available to me, I eagerly took the chance to learn more about how everything technology works. My passions and interests in IT are with PC building as well as coding. The hands-on and potential for problem solving aspects are huge factors for me and when everything comes together and it works, there is no better feeling in the world. I have no formal experience in the IT field; however, I have built several computers as well has helped friends troubleshoot issues they have had. I have also in the past dabbled in coding back in high school. I am part of The Coop, arguably the greatest group of people in this course. The way everyone in the group gets along is more than I could have hoped for and is going to be the gateway to everyone giving this assignment everything they have because we will all want everyone to not just pass, but pass with flying colours. </p>  
<p><b>Connor Litchfield - S3913885 - S3913885@student.rmit.edu.au.</b> I have been pulling apart appliances and electronics since I could pick up a screwdriver, I was luck enough to attend a primary school that had computers albeit very few and very old. I love coding to make random little pieces of VBS software to help me with my daily life at work and at home, but my true passion lays in reverse engineering. I have had experience mainly in a hobby sense with, Raspberry Pie, VBS (lots of experience), C++, Python, Arduino, 3 Modelling, AutoCAD, Paint shop, Game Dev (Unreal), Android Dev. I am super excited to start my Bachelor of Information tech, I am part of team The Coop. The Coop consist of the coolest group people I have ever had to work with. I am excited to be working with these wonderful people.</p>
<p><b>Daisy - S3923673 - S3923673@student.rmit.edu.au.</b> My parents both immigrated to Australia from Vietnam during a war. My mum’s side is Chinese and my dad’s side is Vietnamese. I can speak neither but I can understand Cantonese. My hobbies have changed a lot recently and that is due to autoimmune conditions that I have developed in the last 3 years. They are called cholinergic and cole urticaria. I used to compete for surf lifesaving with surf boats, I loved to swim and participate in several sports. Now I frequent the computer a lot more. Playing games, watching anime or practicing.  My IT interest mainly revolves around machine learning and AIs. I also have very basic understandings of programming. I look forward to working with The Coop and seeing what we can achieve together. </p>
<p><b>Michael - S3921705 - S3921705@student.rmit.edu.au.</b> My name is Michael I have a European background, but I was born in Australia. In 2019 I graduated from year 12 and pursued plumbing for about 2 years and realised that I wouldn’t be happy working as a plumber for the rest of my life so now I work part time as a plumber while I study IT at RMIT. My interest in IT started when I played a video game on the pc when I was 8 years old, I found it difficult to make friends at school and I couldn’t find anything to do at home. That’s when I started playing games on the computer and Nintendo 64. Playing games helped me throughout all my schooling, taking me away from the real world that’s filled with stress and anxiety at times. I've always felt attached to computer technology ever since I started using it, but I've never learnt how they work and what happens behind the scenes, so now I want to take my chance to take my interest in IT further by taking an IT course and to find my passion in IT. I currently have my eye on Cyber security but I'm not 100% sure what that career involves in detail. The only experience I’ve had was IT class in high school, we covered a bit of python and algorithms. I’ve also built a few computers for fun. During assignment 2 and 3 I’ll be working with The Coop who are very easy to get along with and are quite supportive to one another. So, I am very happy to be part of The Coop.</p> 
<p><b>Nemat S3856300 - S3856300@student.rmit.edu.au.</b> My name is Nemat, I am 26 years old. I come from Syria. I came to Australia, Melbourne 4 years ago. I finished a high school in my country but could not complete my studies at university due to the war has been started. When I arrived at Melbourne, studied 2 years of Advanced Diploma of Information Technology and Computer System Technology at TAFE. I also did CCNA courses with Cisco. Since I did Cisco course, I have been loved the Networking. Now, I am studying full time bachelor’s degree. I have many IT’s interest since I started my study in IT field. The top 3 for; Networking, Programming and Computer Science but the most interesting for me is Networking (network fundamentals, network access, IP connectivity, IP services...) so, this my passion and my goal after finishing the bachelor’s degree. I don’t have work experience as I haven’t worked yet. I am in a the group The Coop, a team of the kindest and most helpful people. I am excited to do this subject with them. Wishing all the best to all of them.</p>

<h1>Team Profile</h1>
<p>Within our team, we have one person who excels at providing guidance and direction for the group, two people who are excellent at analysing information logically which helps with decision making and the remaining three who are driven by their passion for what they do and their creative minds. We each have our own learning style, and fortunately with this being an online degree it allows us to explore what we are being taught in the way that works best for us.<br>
Between the six of us, we all share common results from the test, we feel this means that we will be able to understand each other with ease and this will lead to a more effective working environment. Common themes between all of us are that we all have the ability listen and be open to other’s ideas. We also are all quite socially competent, allowing us to convey our thoughts and ideas in an open conversation.<br>
The results from each of the tests indicate that we bring a healthy balance of positive traits to the group. Each of us bring our unique strengths, each excelling in different aspects to help provide support to everything and anything our team needs.<br></p>

<p>In order to facilitate the creation of this report our team have used Github.<br>
We have created a Github repository and invited all our team members to be collaborators in it.<br>
We have decided to have a minimum requirement of 3 members approve a pull request, this keeps the process diplomatic and will minimize user error in 
the code, because now 3 sets of eyes have to look at it.</p>
<p>These are shortened URL links, it was decided by the group that to have
a shortened URL without out group name to the repository looks much nice,
google firebase and their Dynamic Links service was very handy here.</p>

<!-- It Interview -->
<div ID="ItInterview">
<h1>Interview with a IT specialist</h1>
<p>On the 29th of September we interviewed Jon O’Shea about his job as a Data Administrator. He gave us many insights into his daily work life, working with large databases. During the interview we touched on points such as: databases, what a data administrator does, how to work well in a team and how to get a job in IT. </p>
<p>Analysing Data is one the most import roles a data analyst can do and with the help from Gartner many projects can be put together. Gartner is the leading research and advisory company around the globe. They have ever expanded research to provide to companies around the world, providing advice and tools they need to achieve their goals and build a great organisation. When data analysis receives projects, they get asked questions on how the project will be developed. Gartner is a great company to visit to identify and evaluate trends in a database which can help data analysis proceed with their project.</p>
<p>Being a data analysis requires understanding users and predicting what they will do or what they need for the job and problem and if the data stops working due to user input the data analysis must be good at problem solving and resolving the issue. It is important to have attention to detail when manipulating data, so the quality of the data stays decent and spotting mistakes other users make. Backing up files is a must because technology is not 100% reliable and files can become corrupted or the data in the file has been edited incorrectly crashing the file. This can also be avoided by branching off from the main project editing it in a separate branch. When projects are branched off it creates a copy of the project in a different timeline allowing the user to manipulate it however, they seem fit. The most challenging part of the job is implementing new systems but working together as a team with more communication can make this job easier for everyone. Try and look for a way to challenge yourself within the company to learn new things and to improve your quality of work. When you are confident enough you can go even further and look for improvement in your work by making managing projects more efficiently and try cutting corners with keep the quality in tacked, making it easier for yourself and the end user.  Don’t plan too far ahead of the project because technology is changing rapidly in the recent years changing up the structure and systems of the company.</p>
<p>Most IT projects are done in teams. Every team is different and will face challenges. Mr O’Shea spoke about main components that make teams run better. Trust was the first one, meaning that we need to trust each other’s abilities and each other. Doubting someone can make them feel incompetent that could lead to low work ethic. Another part is diversity. Keeping a team diverse opens it to new ideas and concepts as every person has a different perspective. Similarly, to trust communication plays a large role in team performance. If people do not communicate ideas or opinions well it could lead to conflict and missed opportunities with concepts. Jon also mentioned the importance of being open to other ideas and allowing equal space to share their opinions. Letting your teammates be heard helps the team be cohesive with all parts of the project and will aid in accord. Seeking regular feedback and allowing people to make mistakes further assists in improving the quality of work output by each individual member of the team. Letting your team know about your views and vice versa will help the overall flow of the project. </p>
<p>Getting into the IT industry has evolved a lot since it’s initial conception. Although you are not required to have certification there is an advantage to having one as it shows you have understanding to a certain level. With studying you can find many apprenticeships hosted by small and larger companies. The benefit to this is that you can study and work at the same time and your employer may want to hire you after the completion of your degree. Cadet ships are also a good option that facilitates on-site learning and growth. It tends to be more hands on and done at the completion of your degree or if you have no degree at all. Graduate programs, much like the name suggests, are for students who have graduated and are ready to begin one of their first jobs in the field. It often is supported by larger companies, and you get a mentor to help you to along the way. Tertiary holiday programs are run so that students can gain experience with full time work without the additional stress of study. It is a great way for employers to see that you are eager and are actively looking to learn more. Finally, unpaid work and volunteering is great to get both experience and notoriety that will hopefully lead to an employer reaching out to you for job opportunities. However, unpaid work is very easily turned into free labour so letting them know you will not work over 6 months without getting paid is optimal experience. There are several ways to get into the IT industry and it depends on the person to pick which route is best for them. </p>
<p>Overall, IT is a very broad blanket term used for many niches but important roles in modern society. Interviewing a professional about their field allowed a better understand on what a job in IT really looks like. Learning about data analyst specifically, teamwork, and getting into the industry itself.</p>

<h1> Our Project Idea </h1>
<h2> Description of the Project </h2>
<p>The app will have various categories that relate to everyday homes. Each category will have many different sections that the user will be able to select. The sections will expand to a list of problems. When the user selects a problem there will be a page outlining the issues with multiple solutions and with a detail step by step guide. There will also be multiple tabs that can be selected.<br>
First will be the overview of the problem which will include the solutions and additional information in written format (includes pictures as well).<br>
The second tab will be a video tutorial on how to solve the problem. The information present in the overview/solution and video tab will be outsourced from recommended sources with acknowledgement to respected sources.<br>
The last tab will be a discussion/forum page for users to discuss and be able to provide additional information or seek help from moderators or other users.</p>
<p>The app will also include a suggestion component that will allow users to contact the app moderators with ideas for current issues that they want addressed or to provide addition solutions to already existing problems. If a user wishes to post in forums or provide suggestions, they will have to create an account by either using google account or using their email. Creating account will allow users to create a profile for themselves as well in the profile section. The user profile will include; profile pictures, usernames, description, and user ratings.<br>
The user ratings system will be a user interactive system between the community. Users will be able to rate other user’s helpfulness on individual forum posts. Each user will also be able to view profiles of other users which will also link them to all their forum post.<br>
The forum post will be organised in the categories which users can select to be directed to the post. All forum post will be managed with profanity filtering AI (Artificial Intelligence) as well as being monitored by moderators regularly. If a user has a problem another user’s post, they can report that user on that user's profile page. The report will be sent to the moderators and thank the user for submitting the report.</p>
<p>Under the profile on the side bar will be a settings tab. Settings will include: account, language, display, User agreement, privacy policy, content policy, help centre, report an issue, and build information. The account section will allow users that are not logged in to login which will lead to a sign in page that can also be used to create an account or to recover forgotten information. If the user is logged in then the profile tab will allow them to logout or change their password (if selected leading to a password reset screen). The language tab is to change the app language to any language. Display tab will let user’s change to dark or light mode. The policy tabs will let the user view each different policies or agreements in their entirely. The report an issue section is for users to report problems with the app’s technical abilities.</p>
<p>In our app there will be several sections to cover all aspects of home living and maintenance. The main category will be home living. Within this category there will be the following subsections. Plumbing, this will encompass tutorials for basic maintenance such as why there is no water coming from your tap, why you hear a loud noise when turning the tap on, fixing leaking appliances (such as taps,water meters or toilets), no hot water coming from your tap, how to fix blocked drains (recommended chemicals, methods, etc.) and why there is no water going to the cistern. Etc. </p>
<p>In this category there will be tutorials on how to clean the house and your clothes. There will be a subcategory with tutorials on how to remove intense stains from whites and how to operate a washing machine and maintaining it. The other subcategory contains tutorials on what chemicals to use and how to use them on showers, bathtubs, basins, and toilets to get the best results. The third subcategory will contain tutorials on how to clean all types of floors; Marble, Tiles, Hardwood, Bamboo, carpet and how to clean all the dirt from the grout between tiles making the floor look brand new. The last subcategory will contain information about how to clean and maintain your appliances, for example; Fridges, dishwashers, and washing machines. </p>
<p>While most are familiar with everyday tech, sometimes there are a few things that are easy to miss, like what cable goes where when connection a surround system. This section is to help with that by giving the user helpful information and videos for diagnosing minor tech issues. In this section we would like to cover basic pc skills too, such as cleaning and caring for your pc i.e. how to effectively clean a keyboard and mouse, how to check the heatsinks are clean on some pcs, and minor upgrade procedures such as replacing ram, Graphics cards and so forth. (A lot of links to Linus)</p>
<p>The app will also include a cooking section which will include recipes, food storage hacks and essential utensils for the kitchen. For each recipe, the user can change the portion sizes and find where they are able to purchase these ingredients by using an embedded grocery store interface. Through this you can compare prices and if you can buy it at that store. Alongside this we will advertise people’s recipes for a monthly subscription. If an applicable video is available, it will also be embedded into the tutorials. Sub sections for recipes will be added to make it easier to navigate and find applicable recipes for the right occasion. Sub sections such as family meals, student friendly recipes, special occasions etc. Another sub section for food storage hacks that would contain; how to store fresh fruit and vegetables, useful tools for the kitchen and what containers to use. This section will detail both cost effective ways as well as environmentally friendly options. Overall, the purpose for this category is to assist with making cooking and prepping an easier task and promote a healthy personal interest.</p>
<p>The section for resumes and interviews will cover the ideal way to write a resume along with how to style it. It will include things such as what skills you should include, how to format your qualifications and previous work history and who to include as references. The interviews portion will give some examples questions of what may be asked in an interview to help you prepare, as well as suggestions of what type of attire to wear depending on the kind of job you are going for.</p>
<h2>Outdoor maintenance</h2> 
<p>	Will contain equipment, machines, and chemicals you might need to maintain your garden and pools.
    <br>
	These are some tools and machines used to maintain your garden:
	 <ul>
	    <li>Hoses for watering the garden.</li>
		<li>Spades for planting trees and flowers.</li>
		<li>Rakes for gathering and cleaning leaves.</li>
		<li>Hedge trimmer to cut back bushes.</li>
		<li>Lawn mower for cutting the grass.</li>
	    <li>Whipper snipper is used to support the lawn mower in cutting grass in awkward spots.</li>
        <li>Mulcher to cut up trees to produce mulch that protects soil moisture, prevents weeds from growing and improving fertility and health of the soil.</li>
	 </ul>
</p>
<p>Another category that will be added is about maintain your pool. The first thing you must do daily is skim the surface of your pool which takes about ten minutes and keeps the water clean. It is important to remove leaves and dirt from the surface of the water, so it doesn't sink to the bottom and stain the pool floor. Once the dirt has been brushed from the walls to the floor, they can be then vacuumed by an automatic pool vacuum, along with any other dirt that has floated from the surface to the bottom and always keep your filtration system running to clean thew water. Lastly regularly check the chemicals in the pool to make sure no bacteria are growing.</p>
<h2>Pets</h2>
<p>There will be a category on how to take care of a household pets, for example, cat, dog, and hamster. This will contain scheduling of how often they are required to be fed to make sure they stay fit and healthy and how to groom and essentially take care of them if need be. There will be a list of products you can buy like toys and essentials as well. The app will provide links to websites on how to train your pet to listen to you and behave more appropriately around the house for example, potty training.</p>
<p>The Glossary will be where you can go to look up terminology for anything you fully understand so you can read a brief definition of it. You will be able to get to this section either by selecting it from the menu, or by pressing highlighted terms within the subject you are reading about. You will be able to tell what words are in the glossary when you are reading as the word will be coloured differently from the rest of the text and underlined as well.</p>

<h2>Tools & Tech</h2>
<p>To make our app we need tools, there are many programs that can be used to make apps in both Android and Apple. With the way this app will function we will probably require multiple programs to help use. There doesn’t appear to be many that do it all. After some research I would suggest the following programs.</p>
<p>Appery although not free has a lot of features and is probably a good starting point, Appery will make interfacing and setting up the online database’s required for this project much easier. Appery how ever is not free and is used to make very functional but boring interfaces.</p>
<p>We need a good-looking interface, our target audience will already have a very short attention span and a boring interface would just be a deal breaker. This is where Mobile Roadie will shine, although not very technical it does give a lot more control of interface look and feel.</p>
<p>This can all be accomplished using the native Android and Apple studios, but the interfaces for these are quite complex and usually require a lot of coding skill.</p>
<p>Cloud services, although most of our app will link to handy article, we still want the function for users to communicate in a form style interface and suggest items for our app, to do this the app will need to interface with a database to get this information to display. This is where we need a cloud computing service of some description or possibly multiple.</p>
<p>And finaly we need the hardware to program thins on, although most of our team members have computers, and some of these programs such as Appery are cloud based.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>In order to make a effective app we need some skills, Coding, Art, Interface, Perception, all these can be called Design Skill.</p>
<p>Coding, even though most programs for making apps have templates we still need to do some coding, to either add a online feature or just to change something the template doesn’t suit for our app.</p>
<p>Art, this makes up most of the interface the user sees, without interesting icons, wallpapers or features the app will just look like a glorified spreadsheet and no user wants that.</p>
<p>Interface, this is arguably the most important feature of a app. The interface is what the user sees and a well done interface can be the difference between a good and bad app. But its not just the look it’s the feel, image a interface where everything is just 2 to 3 taps away, is easy to read, clearly stated, easy to find, looks great and doesn’t get tiresome to use. Now think of a interface that looks great but takes 8 taps to change you profile picture, features that you use on a daily basis hiding inside a menu in a menu in a menu, so many buttons icons and text that you need glass’s to see it, that’s a bad interface. The user shouldn’t have to work to use your app, it should feel natural like second nature.</p>
<p>Perception, we need to have to foresight to know what a user will like. If we have to release 10 updates to make a app useable, then by the time that happens it already has a bad score on the store and no one cares anymore. Foresight is paramount without it you might as well not bother.</p>
<p>How are we going to get these skills? Training there are plenty of free and paid for online courses that cover all these skills. There should be no reason why anyone couldn’t make their own apps, you just need to put the effort and research in.</p>
