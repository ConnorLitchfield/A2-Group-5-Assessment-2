<div ID="Summary">
<h1><span style='font-size:26.0pt'>Summary</span></h1>
&nbsp;
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Hello, I was born and raised in Brisbane QLD. I have some German heritage, but. I'm not 100% sure, unfortunately, my family is very heavily scattered to the winds.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I finished primary school in 1994, but it was not until the end of high school in 2006, before I realised where my true passion laid in IT and what it meant to me.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>After high school. I moved into work immediately. I haven't stopped working since I left high school.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>My first job I was a receptionist at a mobile phone repair company. I was supposed to be a mobile phone repair technician, that's what the job description was. But it didn't turn out that way. And that's such a shame, because I really grew to enjoy disassembling components and devices. I am a reverse engineer by nature.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>My second job I moved onto Star Trek Express. I was a freight handler loading and unloading trucks by hand, driving forklifts and so forth. That wasn't a very mentally challenging job, but it was certainly physical. I knew it wasn't for me and I had to move into something more mentally engaging.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>My third job. Was working for a fire extinguisher repair company. We would service fire extinguishers, disassemble and clean them then put them back together & charge them up. It was repetitive work. Which I didn't mind. But again, I didn't see myself staying there. I just saw it as a stopgap. It wasn't what I truly wanted to do.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Finally I wound up working for public transport. I completed auto electrician apprenticeship. I must admit I was very lucky to be offered an apprenticeship at the age of 21. I learned so much about Electro technologies, which improved my hobbies of reverse engineering. When my apprenticeship ended. They needed someone to be a storeman and that's what I am currently getting paid to do, for the last two years now. I haven't minded the storeman roll. I've had a chance to use a massive suite of software's, as a result I understand a lot more about GUI now.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I've written multiple HTA applications to help me with entering data that I shouldn't have to type repeatedly. And that alone has taught me a lot. Again, this comes back to my reverse engineering by nature.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>My general theory is, If you spend more time doing the repeated task per day. Then it would take to write a programme to do it for you. Then why haven't you written a programme yet?</span></p>

<!-- My interest in IT -->
<div ID="MyInterestInIT">
&nbsp;
<h1><span style='font-size:26.0pt'>My interest in IT</span></h1>
&nbsp;
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I've always been interested in IT for as far back as I can remember. But it wasn't until the end of high school before it got really Interesting to me. I did a few information technology classes in high school, but I've never been overly interested in the curriculum that the school had.
<br>I sort of taught myself. I spent more time learning visual basic and what I could do with it, than concentrating on my studies like I should have been.
<br>I can't say that there was a particular event that sort of sparked it off for me. I started to understand more the world around me and how information technology was changing our world. We had become so dependent on it. And the power that it holds. I want to be a part of that.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<p align=left><span style='font-size:24.0pt'>How I got started on my learning path with RMIT</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In the later years of my current employment, I noticed that I was stagnating in the Storemans role. And I needed to move on. It wasn't what I wanted to do, and it wasn't where I wanted to be. I wanted to be in IT. Ultimately, I wanted to teach it. Not in the sense of a lecturer, but more in the sense of. Training and tutorials for people who aren't so good with technology.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I suppose I got sick of. Telling myself you can't apply for that job. And getting knocked back on the jobs that I did apply for because of Order of Merit, someone else had the degree I didn't. And I decided enough, it's time to actually do something about this instead of just sitting on my hands and hoping that I got the job I wanted.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>When I finally made the decision to Start learning a Bachelor of Information Technology. I did a lot of research, and RMIT had everything I needed. No one had anything bad to say about RMIT, and it turned out to be an amazing place to start learning again especially for someone who hasn't been learning at any sort of institution for a long time. For me over 14 years.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<p align=left><span style='font-size:24.0pt'>What am I expecting to get out of the Bachelor of infotech degree?</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I'm expecting to get a advanced understanding of the technological world that we live in. How it can help us. How it can increase quality of life. And also, what we can do to avoid the pitfalls that can hide inside of technology itself.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Not only do I expect to understand technology, its pros and cons much better. But I'm also expecting to learn how to work in a team, how to deal with people on real world issues when it comes to information technology.</span></p>

<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The position entails training staff to use new software and hardware, that the RSL organization will soon be transitioning to as their major IT system. This appeals to me greatly, I want to teach people new software and how to use devices that they never have before.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:24.0pt'>The skills RSL require</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The RSL organisation is after someone, who has.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A degree in IT, A highly level of written and verbal communication skills. This means they need to be good at dealing with customers face to face and general customer service. This person needs the ability to work under pressure and meet deadlines at the same time, the ability to self-organise and the knowledge to prioritise correctly in also imperative. Understand how to deal with sensitive and confidential information is a must due to the nature of this business. </span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:24.0pt'>The skills I have</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I have really good experience with dealing with customers face to face. And training people on usage of technologies. I've been doing it my entire life. And I always get lots of comments about how well I deal with. Anyone? No matter their nature.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I do have very good verbal communication skills. Unfortunately. I don't have very good written skills. I make plenty of spelling errors and grammatical mistakes.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>To address the written communications issue. I'm</span> hoping that I will learn naturally much better written communication skills, especially as I'm getting through the Bachelor of Information Tech. If I find towards the end of my bachelor that I'm still struggling with written communication skills, then I will need to take on another course to teach me better written communication skills.</span></p>

<div ID="ProjectSummary">
<h1><span style='font-size:26.0pt'>Summary</span></h1>
&nbsp;
<p align=left><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>How this idea came into being.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Hi im Connor Litchfield, Auto electrician by trade and storeman by job description. During my time working for an extremely large organisation, I have noticed one glaring flaw, that is the SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) system. Nothing is standardised no two look the same, no two are stored in the same place, and there are repeats of repeats with differing information for the same outcome. But need not despair I think I have found the solution.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<p align=left><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>What is a SOP?</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A SOP is a Standard Operating Procedure, this can take the form of a written set of instructions teaching the perspective reader how to safely perform a specific task.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The tasks can involve a high-risk physical task, i.e. mechanical repair, use of a certain piece of machinery even just a introduction to picking the right PPE for the right job based on common sense risk, cuts, abrasions, eye damage, hearing damage, heat injuries, cold injuries, crushing injuries, muscular or skeleton injuries.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<p align=left><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>Introducing S3OP!</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>S3OP the future of SOP design and standardisation. </span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Super Simple Standard Operating Procedures or S3OP for short, is a concept for a new software that will undo the complicated nature of creating and maintaining SOP libraries.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>All while standardizing and centralising your SOP's.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A SOP is a Standard Operating Procedure, so why are no two alike? With S3OP they will be! S3OP will have a locked down template designed by your team, this means that collaborators can create to their hearts content, but every SOP in your library will look and read the same way. </span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A SOP is a Standard document so why is there one here... and there... and some in that folder. and a few on the network drive. If this is meant to be standard, then why aren't these stored in a standard way! Well with S3OP they will be! S3OP has a fully customisable tree style library structure, so that any collaborator can easily find existing SOP's before creating new ones and find where to put their shiny new SOP so that its easy to find and read for those who need it most. </span></p>
</div>
<!-- How it Works -->
<div ID="HowItWorks">
&nbsp;
<h1><span style='font-size:26.0pt'>How it works.</span></h1>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The standard template</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The S3OP is fully automated and will generate a standardized and complete SOP for the user with minimal input required. </span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>S3OP will including a built-in word-processing interface for every step, this will allow the user to enter text with all the formatting they need. </span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>This software will have an easy to use interface. </span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1. The user is prompted to supply a title and photo that will be used for the SOP front cover.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2. The software will ask the user for a step to go into their SOP and a picture if applicable to be added to this step.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3. The user now adds as many steps as they like.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4. As the user enters a step to the SOP a bar along the bottom of the screen will show a new point along their SOP timeline.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>5. The user Saves the document to a position in the tree library.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The user can Print the SOP if desired, this will place a mandatory "Printed on dd/mm/yyyy" to show readers how old this document is.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The software has the ability for the user to delete and edit steps, all while auto saving the document as they go. This can be implemented in very simple way for the user, the user just clicks a step in the time line bar and S3OP will take the user to that step and display it in edit mode.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<p align=left><span style='font-size:26.0pt'>Permissions</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A permission system will be implemented this. This will take the form of a hierarchy system, where the user who creates the document has implicate access to modify their new document. </span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A next in the hierarchy will be the next in charge, i.e. manager. The manager will have access to modify any document created by a user under their position, this position can specific if a user below their position does or does not have creation / edit permission. This allows the manager to specify specific people for their team who can modify / create documents, all while allowing any user (Guest) to view SOP's from S3OP.</span></p>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>This hierarchy system will continue like this until, eventually there is one user or group of users with ultimate modify permission, i.e. your Tech Support team.</span></p>
</div>
<!-- Skills Required -->
<div ID="Skills">
&nbsp;
<h1><span style='font-size:26.0pt'>What skills will I need to create this?</span></h1>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I believe the best way to accomplish this would be using HTML5. HTML5 would give the easiest to program and most visually appealing outcome.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>HTML5 CSS</span></h2>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I need to have a much better understanding of HTML5 than what I currently do, and advanced skills in CSS usage is also required.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>GUI Design</span></h2>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I will need to learn and understand GUI creation, so that I can design something that is not only visually appealing but useable. Without being overly complex for the user.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>User permission management protocols</span></h2>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I will need to learn and understand, how to implement and maintain a user permissionmanagement system, so that the software has a place where it can draw on permission status for a user, before allowing Create/Edit/Modify access.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<h2><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Data storage</span></h2>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>How & where is this software going to store all these documents, I will need to research this heavily as finding a one fits all solution for every user maybe be very difficult, especially if the customer wishes to store the SOP library on their own servers. </span></p>
&nbsp;
</div>
<!-- What will S3OP Achieve -->
<div ID="WhatWillS3OPAchieve">
<h1><span style='font-size:26.0pt'>What will S3OP accomplish?</span></h1>
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>S3OP will unify the creation of standard operating procedures, this will make storying creating and editing SOP's uniform and standard. But most importantly this will make finding a SOP so much easier and faster for a reader. </span></p>
&nbsp;
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> Imaging a situation where an employee comes to a new task for them, and a task with inherent risk at that. The employee makes the smart decision to seek out a SOP so they can perform this task in a smart safe way. But cannot find the SOP now mater where they search, or the employee decides not to bother searching at all, because they know that the search will take a very long time and will probably yield no results. Now this employee will just perform this task by just "winging it".</span></p>
&nbsp;
<p align=left><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Duplication will also be solved, if a creator looks in the SOP tree and can see a SOP that already exists for the subject matter than there is no need to create a new one, this means no duplicates.</span></p>
