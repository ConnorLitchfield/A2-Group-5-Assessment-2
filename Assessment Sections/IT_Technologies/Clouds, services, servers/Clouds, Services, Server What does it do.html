<h2>Clouds, Services, Servers. What do they do?.</h2>

<p>Cloud services is set to become the new norm world over, and arguably already is.</p>

<p>So what is the cloud? VOX.com quotes it as.</p>

<blockquote>“The cloud refers to software and services that run on the Internet, instead of locally on your computer.”<BR>
Bonnie Cha of VOX.com</blockquote>

<p>The Cloud is a digital landscape made up of millions of servers, pc’s and infrastructure worldwide. The services the cloud supplies include but is certainly 
not limited to are, Facebook, Messenger, Email, Apple ICloud, Google Drive. These services operate in this landscape. When you watch that YouTube video its coming 
to you from not just one hard drive in one location, that video could be coming to you in bits pulled together by the YouTube servers from all over the world to 
send you that complete content.</p>

<p>The Cloud sits in a constant state of “State of the art”, this is due to the non centralized nature of the cloud. Cloud services have done away with the need 
to local infrastructure to do your computing both personally and for business. The Cloud is made up of millions or more, of computers called servers all around the 
world in massive data centres. These data centres always have the most up to date cutting edge technology, if they didn’t they would be able to compete in this now 
cut throat industry. What’s a data centre <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfvbCggY_nI">Click Here</a> for a great video.</p>

<p>Cloud services can bring you content from around the world, but the cloud is capable of so much more. Some organisations and governments are leveraging the huge 
amount of computing power behind the cloud to perform incredible data calculations, this usually falls into a few processing buckets, Machine Learning is a major 
benefactor of this performing power. Machine learning is as the name suggests, the feed a computer algorithm massive amounts of data and then the algorithm runs 
thousands if not millions of simulations based on that data, the algorithm is told whats bad and what’s good then the algorithm gets to work learning from its 
mistakes with each interation, until a desired outcome is reached. This can include prediction of stocks, weather based on past trends, even identifying peoples of 
interest in real time, prediction of movement of people in high foot traffic areas.</p>

<p>With the ability to leverage huge amounts of computing power, we will see a future where that heavy metal box on your desktop could be a thing of the past. 
In 3 years of less we could see virtualization services move from just being a corporate service to the become a service used by private PC users too. It already 
appears to be an attractive prospect, why pay nearly $2k for a gaming PC when you could rent a virtual PC in the cloud for a fraction of the cost billed monthly 
instead of a lump sum. Due to the online nature of this Virtualized PC, you could literally log into it from almost any web enabled device, Your phone, tv, even 
your web enabled car (Future Tech), could possibly be your pc on the run. The best part of these virtualized machines is you don’t need to decide what hardware you 
want now, due to the virtual nature of these you just pay for a better tier with more CPU cores and ram. Tresorio offers this already check out their website

<p>We will also see a future where machine learning and AI becomes so powerful leveraging off the back of the cloud, that we may not be able to tell the difference 
between a human and a AI. Or we may find the human race in a situation where AI’s will have rights and deleting a hard drive could be considered murder of a intelligent being.</p>
