<h2>Clouds, services, servers How will this affect you?</h2>

<p>Cloud, services, and servers work together to enable me to access data anywhere and at any time. I can enrol online and participate in online learning activities. 
Cloud computing has enabled RMIT to use the storage cloud to store large amounts of data securely and share it with me.<BR>
I can live stream my favourite movies on Netflix because of cloud, services, and servers. I can also look for friends I have spoken to for many years or friends I 
talk to daily on services, but with the service development of social networks like Facebook and Instagram, it's much easier to connect with friends and people 
through the online community.<BR>
Whenever I drive somewhere I use my phone for navigation for example, google maps. Cloud, servers, and services has enabled these navigation programs to store large 
amounts of data and regularly update it to assist us. Whenever I use these tools, I indirectly utilizing the cloud to travel form one place to another, and it prevents 
me from getting lost and finding the fastest route.</p>

<p>After reading about Clouds, services, and servers I now realise how important they are to the world, especially the security side of things. If we are going to use 
Clouds, services, and servers we all must learn about security, or our sensitive data can be accessed and cause a lot of problems. When we access certain sensitive data 
itâ€™s a great idea to enable a VPN which hides your IP from hackers and protects your data while accessing it. Another great security measure is creating very strong 
passwords and never use the same password for more than one service. After securing your data in the cloud and services it is the most efficient and fasts way to send 
and receive data.</p>

<p>My grandparents still live in the past where they send everything via post which is the most unsecure way of sending personal information. Information sent via post 
can be accessed from basic theft, while sending information via the cloud is encrypted making it very difficult for people to steal. After mentioning this system to my 
Grandparents, they wanted to experience the new ways of managing personal data and learning more about how far Clouds, service, and servers have come to make the world 
a better and more efficient place.</p>
