<h2>Cybersecurity What does it do?</h2>

<h3>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</h3>

<p>With machine learning, cybersecurity frameworks can analyse patterns and learn from them to assist anticipate similar attacks and react to changing behaviour. 
It can assist cybersecurity groups to be more proactive in avoiding dangers and reacting to dynamic attacks in real time. It can decrease the amount of time spent 
on routine assignments and enable organizations to utilize their assets more strategically. Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence that gives 
frameworks the ability to naturally learn and progress from involvement without being explicitly modified. Machine learning centres on the improvement of computer 
programs that can access information and utilize it to memorize for themselves. The path of learning starts with observations or information, such as illustrations, 
coordinate encounters, or instruction, to search for designs in data and make better choices within the future based on the illustrations that we offer. The essential 
point is to allow the computers learn naturally without human modifications or help and alter activities accordingly.</p>

<h3>What can be done now?</h3>
<p>Machine learning identifies threats by continually checking the conduct of the network for irregularities. Machine learning engines process massive sums of 
information in near real time to find basic occurrences. These methods permit for the detection of insider threats, obscure malware, and policy violations. Machine 
learning can foresee dangerous websites online to help stop individuals from clicking on the website. Machine learning analyses Web action to naturally distinguish 
attack foundations organized for current and rising threats. Algorithms can detect malware that's attempting to run on endpoints. It distinguishes new malicious files 
and movement based on the properties and practices of known malware. Machine learning can secure productivity by examining suspicious cloud app login movement, 
recognizing location-based irregularities, and scans the IP repeatedly to recognize threats and risks in cloud apps and platforms.</p>

<h3>What is likely to be able to do be done soon?</h3>
<p>Machine learning can help cybersecurity more precisely to identify potential attacks. However, in a few cases these advancements can cause strategies that brings 
new malicious software of their own. A wide range of particular assignments may be completely or mostly computerized with the use of machine learning, with some forms 
of "vulnerability, discovery, deception, and attack disruption. "But a lot of transformative conceivable outcomes still require critical machine learning breakthroughs. 
We expect that machine learning will give incremental progress to cyber defenders, but it is unlikely to change the industry excepting extra breakthroughs. A few of the 
transformative impacts may come from making under-utilized protective procedures available to more organizations. Machine learning will neither be offense-biased nor 
defence-biased, it may change the danger scene by making certain sorts of procedures more engaging to attackers or defenders.</p>

<h3>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h3>
<p>Quantum computers use a new mode of computing based on qubits rather than bits. These units are more adaptable than bits in that they can be on, off or superposed 
between the two. They’re so condensed to the degree that particles are physically connected even though they’re physically separate. These properties let quantum computers 
to move data around and to perform assignments faster and more efficiently than standard computers. The outcomes for quantum computing are endless. Undoubtedly, researchers 
could use quantum computing to acquire AI to a new level. They might create new materials, discover cures to illnesses and alter life in other ways. Large scale quantum 
computers will increase the amount of power output to help cyber defenders in the long run and open new opportunities. Quantum cybersecurity will use the power to identify 
and avoid quantum cyberattacks before they cause a trouble. But it might end up back firing, as quantum computing may also make new exposures and developments to hack and 
plan malicious software and work out the layers of encryption created to protect sensitive data.</p>
