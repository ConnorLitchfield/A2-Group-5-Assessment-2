 <h1>Skills</h1>
 
<p>In order to make a effective app we need some skills, Coding, Art, Interface, Perception, all these can be called Design Skill.</p>

<p>Coding, even though most programs for making apps have templates we still need to do some coding, to either add a online feature or just to change something the template doesn’t suit for our app.</p>

<p>Art, this makes up most of the interface the user sees, without interesting icons, wallpapers or features the app will just look like a glorified spreadsheet and no user wants that.</p>

<p>Interface, this is arguably the most important feature of a app. The interface is what the user sees and a well done interface can be the difference between a good and bad app. But its not just the look it’s the feel, image a interface where everything is just 2 to 3 taps away, is easy to read, clearly stated, easy to find, looks great and doesn’t get tiresome to use. Now think of a interface that looks great but takes 8 taps to change you profile picture, features that you use on a daily basis hiding inside a menu in a menu in a menu, so many buttons icons and text that you need glass’s to see it, that’s a bad interface. The user shouldn’t have to work to use your app, it should feel natural like second nature.</p>
 
<p>Perception, we need to have to foresight to know what a user will like. If we have to release 10 updates to make a app useable, then by the time that happens it already has a bad score on the store and no one cares anymore. Foresight is paramount without it you might as well not bother.</p>

<p>How are we going to get these skills? Training there are plenty of free and paid for online courses that cover all these skills. There should be no reason why anyone couldn’t make their own apps, you just need to put the effort and research in.</p>
