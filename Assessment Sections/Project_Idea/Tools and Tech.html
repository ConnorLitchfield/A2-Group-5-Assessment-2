 <h1>Tools & Tech</h1>
 <br>
 
 <p>To make our app we need tools, there are many programs that can be used to make apps in both Android and Apple. With the way this app will function we will probably require multiple programs to help use. There doesn’t appear to be many that do it all. After some research I would suggest the following programs.</p>
 
<p>Appery although not free has a lot of features and is probably a good starting point, Appery will make interfacing and setting up the online database’s required for this project much easier. Appery how ever is not free and is used to make very functional but boring interfaces.</p>

<p>We need a good-looking interface, our target audience will already have a very short attention span and a boring interface would just be a deal breaker. This is where Mobile Roadie will shine, although not very technical it does give a lot more control of interface look and feel.</p>

<p>This can all be accomplished using the native Android and Apple studios, but the interfaces for these are quite complex and usually require a lot of coding skill.</p>

<p>Cloud services, although most of our app will link to handy article, we still want the function for users to communicate in a form style interface and suggest items for our app, to do this the app will need to interface with a database to get this information to display. This is where we need a cloud computing service of some description or possibly multiple.</p>

<p>And finaly we need the hardware to program thins on, although most of our team members have computers, and some of these programs such as Appery are cloud based.</p>
